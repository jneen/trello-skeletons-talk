      (Lisp)

      Abandon infixity!

      - really easy to parse by hand
      - constrains syntax design
      - bad UX if users don't have blessed
        tooling set up
        (recall: non-programmer users)
      - without a good deal of effort, often
        simply pushes parse errors
        to runtime ("malformed form ...")
